# Dragon Fire Wallpaper

I am a programmer and I really like dragons, so I tought: "Why not making my own dragon wallpaper?".

With little effort I crated this cool background using [tsParticles](https://github.com/matteobruni/tsparticles). 

What I wrote is an HTML page which, using [Lively Wallpaper](https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively), can be set as wallpaper. If you want to use Lively as well, the config file is already present, you just need to put this repo inside the _wallpapers_ filder.
